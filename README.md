# Grocery Tracking Program #
**Bryan Chan (2023)**


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
* The following project reads from a grocery list, and undergoes calculations to find the number of frequencies in which an particular item shows up. It helps the user know whether or not a particular item is found in the grocery list.

### What did you do particularly well?
* In this program, I was able to make sure the program adhered to object-oriented principles, since all of its functionalities is based in the `Grocer` class.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
* For the `Grocer` `freqOfGroceryItem()` method, I could have it made it read the grocery list set that was created at the beginning of the program instead of the entire grocery list. This would have made the program find the result at a much faster speed, since it would undergo fewer iterations.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
* The section on Zybook regarding reading files, proved to be helpful when it came to writing the part of the program of when the grocery list needed to be read.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
* Input validation, error handling, and code modularity are some of the important concepts that can be used in other projects.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* By adding modularity, helpful comments, and error handling, this code is able to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
