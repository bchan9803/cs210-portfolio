# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The following project reads from a grocery list, and allows calculates the number of frequencies in which an particular item shows up. It helps the user know whether or not an item is found in the grocery list.

# What did you do particularly well?
In this assignment, I was able to make sure the program adhered to object-oriented design, since all of its functionalities is based in the "Grocer" class.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
For Grocer's "freqOfGroceryItem()" method, I could have it read the grocery list set that is created at the beginning of the program instead of the entire grocery list, which would result in a faster output.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Input validation, error handling, and code modularity are some of the important concepts that can be used in other projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By adding modularity, helpful comments, and with the use of error handling, this code is able to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
